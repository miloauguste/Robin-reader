        ### Grammar Checking & Parallel Editing Features
        
        This implementation provides comprehensive grammar checking with parallel editing capabilities:
        
        #### üîç **Grammar Analysis**
        - **Sentence Completeness Detection**: Identifies missing subjects, predicates, and sentence fragments
        - **Run-on Sentence Detection**: Flags overly long sentences that may need restructuring
        - **Grammar Issue Classification**: Categorizes different types of grammatical problems
        - **Completeness Scoring**: Provides an overall assessment of text quality
        
        #### ‚úèÔ∏è **Parallel Editing Interface**
        - **Side-by-Side View**: Original text on left, editable version on right
        - **Real-time Change Detection**: Highlights when modifications are made
        - **Grammar-Aware Editing**: Shows completion suggestions alongside the editor
        - **Diff Visualization**: Compare original vs edited text with unified diff view
        
        #### ü§ñ **LLM-Powered Completion**
        - **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Uses surrounding text to generate appropriate completions
        - **Issue-Specific Fixes**: Targets specific grammar problems (fragments, missing subjects, etc.)
        - **Preserve Original Intent**: Maintains the author's intended meaning and style
        - **Rate-Limited API Usage**: Manages OpenAI API calls efficiently
        
        #### ‚úÖ **Approval Workflow**
        - **Review Changes**: Examine all modifications before applying
        - **Selective Application**: Choose which suggestions to accept
        - **Revert Capability**: Undo changes if needed
        - **Change Tracking**: Maintain history of all modifications
        
        #### üé§ **Speech Generation**
        - **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Convert edited text to natural-sounding audio
        - **Multiple Engines**: Support for Google TTS and OpenAI TTS
        - **Voice Customization**: Adjust speed, voice type, and other parameters
        - **Audio Download**: Save generated speech files
        
        #### üîß **Integration Features**
        - **Streamlit UI Components**: Ready-to-use interface components
        - **State Management**: Persistent editing sessions
        - **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and user feedback
        - **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new grammar rules and features
        
        ### Usage Workflow
        
        1. **Upload Text**: Load documents through the existing file processing system
        2. **Analyze Grammar**: Run sentence completeness analysis on text chunks
        3. **Edit in Parallel**: Use the side-by-side editor to make improvements
        4. **Apply Suggestions**: Use AI-powered completion suggestions
        5. **Review Changes**: Compare original vs edited versions
        6. **Approve Edits**: Apply changes to the main text
        7. **Generate Speech**: Convert the improved text to audio
        
        ### Technical Implementation
        
        - **GrammarAnalysisAgent**: Core grammar checking logic
        - **ParallelEditingWindowAgent**: Parallel editing session management
        - **ParallelEditorUI**: Streamlit interface components
        - **HumanEditingAgent**: Workflow orchestration and speech integration
        - **Integration Points**: Works with existing LangGraph workflow
